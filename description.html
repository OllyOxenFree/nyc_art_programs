<h1> The Fall of Artistry in NYC Schools? <h1>
<p>
This project focuses its research on art programs in NYC schools from K-12 (including visual arts, music, and theater) and seeing the amount of students that have learned from sufficient art programs in their schools. This project will compare years within this past decade to see if there has been a significant change to the amount art programs incorporated in NYC schools. It will also compare the different boroughs in NYC to determine the better area as well as comparing different grade levels.
