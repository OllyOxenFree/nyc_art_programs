<p> Hello and welcome to my project for CSCI 39542. The focus of this project is researching art programs in NYC schools from K-12 (including visual arts, music, and theater) and seeing the number of students that have learned from sufficient art programs in their schools, comparing years from the past decade and each of the 5 boroughs, which would determine the area that best teaches their students artistically as well as displaying the rise/fall of the art programs of each school through the number of students who've studied the four disciplines of art.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> The sources I will be using for this project are Art Reports from the NYC open data site at <a href="https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/"></a>, and the data used will be from the school years 2014-15, 2015-16, 2016-17, 2017-18, and 2019-20. Their links will be provided at the end of this web page. I will be comparing and contrasting 4 sections from each of these Art Reports, including the <u>% of Graduates that Met Instructional Requirements in Arts</u>, the <u>% of 8th Grade Students that Received 2 Half-units of Instruction in Arts</u>, the <u>% of 8th Grade Students that Received 2 Half-units of Instruction in Arts in Two Different Disciplines</u>, and the <u>% of Schools Serving Grades 1-5 that Provided Arts Instruction in All Four Disciplines (Music, Dance, Theater, Visual Arts)</u>.</p>
